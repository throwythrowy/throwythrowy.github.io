<h1>May 10</h1>
<p>

How did the daily regal get a photo of the cat? Did someone break into my mansion? I have to get to the bottom of this. I just hope that nobody saw this picture in particular, no Polodians. Then again, who in their right mind would read an article about the birthday of a cat? </p>



<h3>THE DAILY REGAL</h3>
<p>
Last week, one of our favourite felines celebrated his third birthday. It is, of course, the aptly named Big Paws, prime mouser in the mansion of Senator Michael Hixton. To celebrate this occasion, we present an exclusive trest, the first photo of Big Paw in the press. See his beautiful black coat with white markings, his huge paws, and of course his beautiful collar with big green gems, surely emeralds. He both looks like a noble, important cat and as if he were dropped into a bucket of white paint. </p>
