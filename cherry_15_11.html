<h1>November 15</h1>
<p>

I’ve met with the Individualist leader, Harald, again. I knew he wouldn’t be happy. Well, Harald, I am also unhappy, let me tell you that. I said it to him clearly, sometimes, there are forces that bind you and make you act against your will and vote against what’s best for you. It’s a bit funny that with all their perceived importance, it’s not the monarch who forced my hand but a chain of much more mundane people. As was expected, Harald was not happy. Told me I was selling this democracy to the highest bidder and bowing to the smallest threats.  He said I am an opportunist without a conscience and without skill. Maybe he is right. I can endure being demeaned, but then he threatened me. He said that the individualists are also a force that can hurt me. Well, I am curious about what he plans to do.</p>
