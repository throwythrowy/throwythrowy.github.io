<h1>January 18</h1>
<p>I noticed someone new at the golf club today. Her name is Irene, and I realize I know nothing about her. 

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw her sitting at the bar. She looked absolutely stunning, but what really caught my attention was her long, full, hazelnut-brown hair, sculpted into a beautiful blow-dry style. I couldn’t take my eyes off it.

It’s sad, really, but I remind myself that I’m not in a position to approach her. A man like me doesn’t ask; he is proposed to — both in politics and romance. If I were to chase someone in public, I could wave goodbye to my public image. At least I overheard the staff calling her Irene. What a lovely name.</p>
