<h1>February 15</h1>
<p>

The Egalitarians' party leader visited today to discuss Bill #176, which proposes new regulations on bromine as a component in green paint. The bill aims to address health concerns after evidence showed that the bromine used to paint cheap toys could cause lasting nervous system damage in children and even pose dangers for adults, especially when combined with alcohol. The party leader appealed to my responsibility as an elected official to protect my voters and their children. Nevertheless, the toy manufacturers' lobbyists continue to send me gifts, so as I don't expect re-election, I'm inclined to side with them. </p>
