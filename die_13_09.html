<h1>September 13</h1>
<p>

I thought about Irene for a long time today. If tensions with the Polodians are rising again, then it is worse by multitudes if anyone finds out I am meeting her. Our ruse is very clever, but the incident with The Daily Regal  in May tells me that nothing stays secret for long. But I need her now more than ever. I need a human connection, now that Big Paw is not doing so well.</p>
