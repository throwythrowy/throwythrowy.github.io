<h1>March 08</h1>
<p>

It could have been a lovely day today, but for some reason, the monarch decided to pay me a visit. These are always unpleasant visits.

The monarch suggested I reconsider my stance on Bill #177. I am still unconvinced. It confounds me how they still don’t know how to convince me. If I make it even more public, I might as well resign. The monarch will get another invitation from me. Maybe a party outside in July could be fun. The days are long by then, and rain around this time is quite uncommon. We could feast in the garden and drink orange cider.

Persuading me will require a lot. The purpose of Bill #177 is evident: more private conversations will only solidify the monarch's influence and give him the opportunity to threaten the Senators. Should the Bill pass, such threats gain actual weight.   </p>
