<h1>May 24</h1>
<p>

I contacted the Egalitarians about my not-so-voluntary change of mind about Bill #177. Barbara, the Egalitarians' leader, seemed to be very happy about that. Apparently, the Egalitarians are now playing the same game as me. Funny, given they were all on a mighty high horse about the voters' wishes when we met in February. Anyway, a certain someone will make a huge donation to a certain party after Bill #177 passes, and this might give the Egalitarians enough of an edge to have two Senators in the Regal Senate after the next election. Well, good for them. By then, I will hopefully be out of politics. </p>
