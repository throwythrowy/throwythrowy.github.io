<h1>December 06</h1>
<p>

The Baker's League showed me pictures of the cakes for tomorrow's feast, and everything looks phenomenal, and it better be. I have invited the leaders of both parties, the monarch, the reporter who wrote about Big Paw - well, not everyone there will be super important, I guess. I just hope there is not another mix-up with the bottles like last week. I still want to sell one of the bottles next week after all.</p>
