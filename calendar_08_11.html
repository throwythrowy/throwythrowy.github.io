<h1>November 08</h1>
<p>

Today was tough. Today, the Regal Senate voted on Bill #177, and it passed. Aye from the Egalitarian senator and Aye from me. Nay from the Individualist senator. And with this, we are undermining our young democracy. It’s not too bad, but it sends a sign. At least the few remaining royalists see this as me being a patriot. That might be helpful if I want to get back into the Secret Service after my time as a Senator is over, or if anyone ever finds out about Irene. I miss you, Irene...</p>
