<h1>June 07</h1>
<p>

The ruse of smuggling Irene into my private chambers every couple of weeks continues. What an exhilarating secret romance. She is giving me what I missed last year. We chat, we laugh, we drink orange cider. I couldn’t be any happier. There was just one odd thing. I always lock Big Paw in a cage before Irene comes by. This time she said that she knows about the cat and wants to see it. With no other choice, I presented my prime mouser, but she just wanted to pet the good boy. I doubt she recognised the collar, and if she did, then I would know who to blame if it ever ends up back in Polodian hands. On the plus side, Big Paw and Irene adore each other, so I don’t have to keep him in the cage. Maybe I should see the positive things in this. I don’t need to lock up Big Paw, and I get Poppy-seed cake. I mean, there is only one way Irene could have found out.</p>
