<h1>August 30</h1>
<p>

Last week, I heard through my connections to the secret service that a Polodian spy has been caught in the palace of the monarch. This is bad, really bad. After the Cold War of the old days, I had hoped that we would find lasting peace. Maybe this is just an accident, just a lone wolf acting without orders. If there are more spies, then our nation is in danger. With threats from outside and inside (remember Bill #177), it’s going to be tough to protect our young democracy. I am also afraid for my own well-being. I might be a target myself, as a former spy. Maybe someone found out that I took the ancient Polodian unification bracelet. That would be very bad.</p>
