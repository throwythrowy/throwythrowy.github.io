<h1>September 06</h1>
<p>

Big Paw has been acting strange lately. I am very worried about my prime mouser. He is only three years old, and he already seems to be mentally deteriorating. I have been catching him meowing at the walls, hissing at nothing, and he barely caught any mice recently. Better not to think about them in the walls, living the big life now that they are out of danger. I am very worried about Big Paw. Of course, he is also protecting more than just this mansion. This problem needs solving.</p>
