<h1>July 19</h1>
<p>

Today was the vote on Bill #176, the bill regulating Bromine paint. I saw some beautiful green jewellery last week, so I voted against it, and neither did the individualists. Too bad, I would have voted for it if Bill #177 wasn’t the more pressing matter. Let’s hope no children try to eat their green soldiers.

Also, I got some green rocks in the mail, which I shouldn’t swallow. Thank you, Bethany.</p>
