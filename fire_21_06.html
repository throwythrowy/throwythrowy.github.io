<h1>June 21</h1>
<p>

A dark day. Nothing is sacred anymore, nothing is safe. I have glimpsed into many dark souls during my lifetime, but this one reigns supreme. Milly Bellington, 12. I think 12-year-old children possess a unique combination of malice, competence and ability to fool grown-ups. 

Milly Bellington is the Queen of Riddles. I used to be the King of Riddles. Not anymore. I still can not believe it. After the 4-hour marathon of brain teasers that is the riddle championship, she somehow won (she must have cheated), and then she looks at me, grins and says ”What an honour, to win against a legend from the past”. I am 34! I am in my prime! “Will you retire?” she asked me later. “You are sharp, but your age seems to take its toll” I am livid.



The main reason I lost was this horrible feeling in my stomach. This must be a plot against me. Someone might have even poisoned me. I need to reclaim my title next year.</p>
