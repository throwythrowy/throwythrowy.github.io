<h1>November 01</h1>
<p>

The year gets worse by the week. I had the most wonderful time getting closer to Irene, and I dread it being over, but it can not continue in this political climate. Anti-Polodian sentiment is at an all-time high, and if anyone ever finds out about us, I will be a traitor in the public eye. I told Irene that I can’t see her anymore, and after she told me what a spineless bastard I was, right fully so, she said something confusing to me. She told me she is sorry that my cat died. Why did she say that?</p>
