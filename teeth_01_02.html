<h1>February 01</h1>
<p>

The monarch sent me a draft of Bill #177, which will be voted on in the Regal Senate soon. The bill requires mandatory private conversations between the monarch and each senator before every vote. They try to support it with a list of unconvincing arguments. The monarch cites the old religion, which says they are meant to be involved in all political processes. What the old religion actually claims is the necessity of an absolutist ruler. They also think that they are simply too smart not to be heard before each vote. This is just funny. I am firmly opposed to the bill, and I am sure that all Senators agree it should not pass. The days of absolutism are over.</p>
