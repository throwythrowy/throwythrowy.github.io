<h1>November 29</h1>
<p>

Today has been a day without politics. My staff is currently training a new Sommelier, and she just keeps messing up. He's dropping bottles left and  right, spilling glasses of wine and cider. He has a talent for identifying hidden gems among the large collection I have acquired over the years, but that does not excuse his clumsiness. He is at the stage where he needs access to my private collection, but instead of bringing the bottle I wanted, he brought the huge one, which nobody is able to pour. And when I asked him how on god’s green earth he wants to pour it, she just stood there, confused and said, “Oh, this really shouldn’t have happened.” Damn right it shouldn’t.</p>
