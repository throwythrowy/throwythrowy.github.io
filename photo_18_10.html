<h1>October 18</h1>
<p>

I am unhappy about the current hiding spot for Big Paw’s collar, in the compartment right underneath the huge bottle of orange cider that I am never going to drink. As things are going with New Polodia and the Regal Senate, there will soon come an evening in which I decide to drink myself into a mindless stupor and then decide, now is the time for the stupid bottle. I will get even drunker, I will spill thick sticky orange cider everywhere, and the next day, my staff will have a clear view of my secret. A rock might be better in the place of the bottle. I should get rid of it. </p>
