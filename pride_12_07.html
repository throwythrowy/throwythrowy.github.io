<h1>July 12</h1>
<p>

My god, what an amazing party, this could not have gone any better. The catering was superb, the Baking League really outdid themselves. There was poppyseed cake, pie filled with exotic mushrooms, and lemon tarte garnished with hempseed.

I had a long chat with the Boss of Bethany & Co., who produce beautiful faux jewellery. They have a new line whose pieces are adorned with fake emeralds, extraordinarily beautiful and just a fraction of the price of actual emeralds. I was told in no uncertain terms that Bill #176 would put an end to affordable jewellery for everyone. I was not convinced by that, but I was convinced after I heard that the parent company of Bethany & Co. owns an emerald mine in the north. I much prefer real emeralds over fake ones.

Also, the Monarch agreed to help me with Milly Bellington.</p>
