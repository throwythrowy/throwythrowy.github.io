<h1>February 22</h1>
<p>
The Bakers League has contacted me about Bill #153. They claim a revision is necessary because it limits their ingredient pool. Do I want to know what they are baking? Next thing I know, someone is dead at one of my parties... Then again, they have been diligently providing pastries and cakes for each of them, so I owe the Baker’s League one. Let’s have a chat with the Egalitarians about this; they have been the biggest proponents of Bill #153. </p>
