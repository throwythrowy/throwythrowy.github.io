<h1>October 04</h1>
<p>

I decided to place the Big Paw’s collar in the secret compartment in my desk, hidden underneath the huge bottle of cider with an opening wide enough to fit an entire orange through. I am never going to drink from this bottle anyway. Pouring the cider out of it must be a nightmare. 

I am still so deeply saddened by Big Paw’s passing. He left a big cat-shaped hole in my heart that can never be filled.</p>
