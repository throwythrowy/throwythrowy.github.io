<h1>March 15</h1>
<p>

Is this heaven? I surely wouldn’t deserve to be in heaven, given my track record — I’d rather live my life to the fullest, even if it means breaking a few eggs to get my omelet. But this must be heaven, for I haven’t felt this good in a long time.

We planned a ruse, Irene and I. She would come by my house in the dead of night with the cleaning staff, then stay. And stay with me, she did. It took her a bit to find her way to my chambers; maybe she got lost. But then we shared some orange cider and whispered about meaningless things. Her hair was as beautiful as it always is, this stunning hazelnut brown. Her accent is just the sweetest sound in my ears. I need to see her again soon!
