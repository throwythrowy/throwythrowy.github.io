<h1>October 25</h1>
<p>

I read this article. This reasoning by the Polodians makes no sense. To my knowledge, no secret agents have been deployed beyond the border in years. It makes me wonder, does my history in the south come back to haunt me? And it makes me think of Irene.</p>

<h3>THE DAILY REGAL</h3>
<p>
Tensions with New Polodia rise again as Polodian officials openly admit to sending secret agents to our nation in an effort to undermine our young democracy. Said the officials, “Don’t fool yourselves, there has been an ongoing shadow war. We have identified many spies amongst our most high-ranking military officers, our enforcement agency, and our voting men and women. If we don’t respond in kind, we will soon find ourselves victims of a hostile takeover from within. We have already gathered evidence of theft of priceless artifacts by the spies, among them a unification bracelet.” </p>
