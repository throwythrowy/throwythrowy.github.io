<h1>May 03</h1>
<p>

The prime mouser has celebrated his third birthday. Only a few things bring me as much joy as celebrating Big Paws. He got the best fresh food my staff could find at the market, a new toy for playing fetch, and some catnip. Big Paws should be lucky that catnip is not covered by Bill #153, like many other substances. Otherwise, my first mouser would now be chasing mice in jail. This way, he just spent the afternoon being high and a complete dork. Tomorrow, he will be back on the job defending my private chambers from vermin and thieves. Oh, Big Paws, if only you’d know how important you are. </p>
