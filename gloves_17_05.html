<h1>May 17</h1>
<p>

The Bakers League informed me kindly that they were behind the photo in last week's article in The Daily Regal. To be honest, I am not even mad at them. What a display of boldness. For now, I will have to meet their demands, I guess. They have no idea that this little power move will lead to a chain of votes from me that give the monarch significant influence over our young democracy. At least this could mean some poppy-seed cake at the next party. </p>
