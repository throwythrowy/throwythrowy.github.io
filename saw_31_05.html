<h1>May 31</h1>
<p>

The upcoming riddle championship won’t leave my mind. Every aspect of my life seems to be controlled by politics, and this was always an escape. Yesterday I heard that Millie's parents are active in the Egalitarian Party. Is this all another power move against me? The Egalitarians were very strange yesterday, and in the current tense climate, anything seems possible. Or maybe it’s the Individualists who try to put pressure on me in my private hobbies. Am I becoming paranoid? I am not feeling well.</p>
