<h1>April 26</h1>
<p>
The Individualists are a funny bunch. I’ve finally come around on Bill #153 and recommend a revision, but they won’t agree to it. They were against this bill from the very start, but now that I want to revise it, they refuse to cooperate. They said that they don’t care about baking ingredients; they care about actual drugs like cocaine. At least that is honest. Sadly, the alcohol lobby paid me quite a bit to not introduce any unnecessary competition, so I will have to find a different way. </p>
