<h1>February 08</h1>
<p>

I can’t believe it! The lady from the golf club approached me, Irene. She carefully chose a moment when I was all alone in the lobby, she sat next to me, and asked me about my handicap. We quickly fell into a deep conversation about politics, the North-South tensions, and so much more. I could talk to her for hours. We planned to meet up. She understands that we can’t meet in public, so we will have to find a different arrangement.</p>
