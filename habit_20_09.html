<h1>September 20</h1>
<p>

The Individualists' leader, Harald, met with me today. He believes a war with our neighbors to the south is imminent. There was a time when war seemed likely, back when I was still in the secret service. But this was a long time ago. Harald said I am naive. The Polodian secret service is already making moves, and if anything is missing, they’d know by now. This was, of course, a jab against me and the souvenir that I took from New Polodia. He said that soon tall soldiers with hazelnut-brown hair would cross the border, sweep my mansion, and take all of the stolen artifacts I had taken. No one is taking anything. I took one small item, and if anyone takes it back, they will get some mean scratches.</p>
