<h1>June 28</h1>
<p>

With the next party coming up soon, I have to start planning. I’ve met again with the Bakers league to discuss the catering. They are acting like nothing ever happened, no invasion of privacy, no photos. Sly bastards... I will get my revenge in due time, maybe once I am no longer in the spotlight. I will need to use the party to squeeze some support out of the monarch. After all, they don’t know I am already forced to be on their side regarding Bill #177. Maybe I can get him to approve a background check of Milly Bellington by regal decree. I am sure she is part of a plot against my mental and physical well-being.</p>
