<h1>March 01</h1>
<p>

Sometimes my colleagues still surprise me. Today I met with Barbara, the Egalitarian leader, and she is willing to assist me in revising Bill #153 if I vote for Bill #177. This Bill is certainly not in the interest of their voters. I told them I would support Bill #176 instead of #177, but they said it’s not enough. Well, so much about the Egalitarians' worry about children dying from green paint.

The Egalitarians were the ones who suggested the harsh restriction on psychoactive substances. There was a big panic campaign directed through The Daily Regal claiming hundreds of daily deaths from substance abuse. Conveniently, they included deaths where the substances were used for medical purposes, such as anesthesia.  </p>
