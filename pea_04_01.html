<h1>January 04 </h1>
<p>A new year, a new journal. Last year was productive. The Egalitarians finally realized I’m not their enemy. I still have some orange cider from their last party, though the bottle’s opening is too big to pour properly — it looks nice, at least. The real win: they’ll block Bill #174 in the Regal Senate tomorrow, which will delight the automobile lobbyists. I hope they are happy after they emptied my spinach rolls at the last party.</p>
