<h1>March 29</h1>
<p>

Big Paw has once again tried to escape. He is still my favourite prime mouser, my cuddly panther, but this is getting on my nerves. He really has a talent for slipping past the few staff members allowed in my private chambers. I had invited my Sommelier to sample the lattes additions to my collection, and that’s when it happened. Greg isn’t the youngest anymore, and he just didn’t notice Big Paw slipping past him when he entered. We notice half an hour later. Luckily, Big Paw was caught quickly. The public really is not supposed to see my prime mouser and his collar. Come on, Big Paw, you are supposed to help me keep this secret. </p>
