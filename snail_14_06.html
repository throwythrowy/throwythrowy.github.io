<h1>June 14</h1>
<p>

Yesterday, the revision of Bill #153 was put to a vote. The Baking League really managed to draft a revision that exclusively covers substances that one would ingest as part of one of their incredibly sweet cakes. Of course, poppy-seed was also covered. The bill passed, of course. The Individualists voted against it, but I know this was just symbolic. They also want their sweets. Harald is just bitter that the only white powder on his cake will be powdered sugar.</p>
