<h1>January 11</h1>
<p>Going over last year's party finances, I noticed that the catering was cheaper than usual. The Baking League really could increase their prices. I hope this isn't going to haunt me, with them making demands for a vote in the Regal Senate. The worst-case scenario is that I will need to bake 3 dozen pies for the next party, all by myself.</p>
