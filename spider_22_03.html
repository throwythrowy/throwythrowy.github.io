<h1>March 01</h1>
<p>

I decided not to vote for Bill #177, because it would give the monarch direct access to me, and I want to avoid them as much as possible. Such an unpleasant and ignorant being. This will make it significantly more difficult to revise Bill #153 as requested by the Bakers League. The Egalitarian Senator will not side with me, but it’s better for them anyway if the bill doesn’t pass. Really, they should be thankful! Nevertheless, I will have to find a different way to please the Bakers League. I mean, for now, they are compensated very well fiscally for their catering. Let’s hope there will not be a drop in quality for the next party. </p>
