<h1>July 26</h1>
<p>

The incident with Irene in June had almost exclusively positive consequences. She and Big Paw are inseparable. Clearly, Big Paw is also happy to avoid being in the cage. I am so happy about this. Life couldn’t be better, except for my continued rivalry with the Queen of Riddles. But I will solve this soon enough. </p>
