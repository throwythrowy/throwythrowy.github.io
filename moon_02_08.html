<h1>August 02</h1>
<p>

The regal decree to investigate my archenemy is underway. This way, I got at least something out of Bill #177. I will find out who is behind Milly Bellington and her confounding win at the riddle championship. My opinion at the time of writing: I have been poisoned. Nothing too bad, just an upset stomach, just enough to make me lose to a 12-year-old.</p>
