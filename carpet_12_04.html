<h1>April 12</h1>
<p>

The baker's league came by in a last effort to convince me to support Bill #177. They brought a huge cart with baked goods to the mansion, and while they were delicious, I was unswayed. This is just not enough to partake in such a blow to the Regal Senate. They don’t know, of course, that this would be the consequence for me, but how could they know? Damn Egalitarians, always making things difficult. 

What was weird to me was the constant noise during the meeting. I could hear Big Paw meow the whole time. Did he find a mouse?  </p>
