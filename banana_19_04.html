<h1>April 19</h1>
<p>

I met Irene again. The same ruse as last time. She hid on one of the huge carts used by my cleaning staff so that the press wouldn’t know. I have to be extra cautious these days. Her hazelnut-brown hair quickly identifies her as having Polodian ancestry. My image as being hard on the Polodians is going to be key to getting me back into the Secret Service after my time as a Senator. </p>
